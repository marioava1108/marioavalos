            <h2>Amazon Storywriter</h2>
            <p>
                In an effort to increase the quality of script submissions to Amazon Studios our team decided to build free screenwriting tool for writers of all skill levels.

            <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <p>
                In the beginning there were user stories. And those user stories were generated off of feedback. This feedback was gathered by our awesome PM <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahkateemerson/" target="_blank">Sarah Emerson</a> who interviewed multiple screenwriters and basically asked them what they wish their current tool did well. I also did some research myself, concentrating on interaction and auto-formating.

            <h3>Whiteboards and Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
                Things move pretty fast at Amazon, so combining wireframes with whiteboard sessions seemed like a good way to maximize productivity in the early part of the process. Looking back I think this made some contributors a bit reluctant to add to the whiteboard. Maybe it seemed more finalized? I don't know. But on the plus side we were able to move quickly and ship with quite a few features.

            <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>
                Here are a just a few samples of interaction design documentation I created for Storywriter.
            </p>
            <h4>Mobile</h4>
            <p>
                Although virtually no-one will be writing a script with a phone. We still wanted users to be able to do other things on a mobile device like:
            </p>
            <p>
                Dashboard organization
                <a href="images/amazon/filter1.png"><img src="images/amazon/filter1.png"></a>
                <a href="images/amazon/filter2.png"><img src="images/amazon/filter2.png"></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Profile management
                <a href="images/amazon/profile1.png"><img src="images/amazon/profile1.png"></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Sharing and notification system (desktop & mobile)
                <a href="images/amazon/mobileshare1.png"><img src="images/amazon/mobileshare1.png">
                </a>
                <a href="images/amazon/share1.png"><img src="images/amazon/share1.png"></a>
            </p>
            <h4>Script menu</h4>
            <p>
                This is how writers manage individual scripts in the dashboard view.
                <a href="images/amazon/assetmenu.jpg"><img src="images/amazon/assetmenu.jpg"></a>
            </p>
            <h4>The Element Picker</h4>
            <p>
                The Element Picker is a formatting tool designed to allow the user to change and/or identify text formats. This was a crucial part of the tool where users would be spending the majority of their time. Here is a diagram showing the interaction experience for the first version of that feature.
                <a href="images/amazon/element1.png"><img src="images/amazon/element1.png"></a>
                Testing this version revealed that users assumed they needed to interact with it. So we changed the design to the more descriptive version in production today.
            </p>
            <h4>Reviews (web & mobile)</h4>
            <p>
                <a href="images/amazon/reviews1.pdf" download>This document</a> shows the review interaction experience. This feature would let users collaborate over individual elements of a script on desktop and mobile devices.

            <h3>The Styleguide</h3>

                I used the Atomic Design method to create the Storywriter design system. You can read more about atomic on <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Brad Frost's blog</a>.

            <h3>The Website</h3>
            <p>
                We needed a place where users could do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sign up to use Storywriter</li>
                    <li>Login to their account</li>
                    <li>Access tutorials</li>
                    <li>Access FAQ's</li>
                    <li>Learn about Storywriter's features</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we had the content for the site I went straight to wireframe to get signoff on information architecture and move to design.
                <img src="images/amazon/wireframe1.jpg">
            </p>
            <p>
                We already had a style guide for that app so design moved quickly. After I finished up the illustrations, all we needed was a nice photo for the header so our PM and I went out with one of our engineers and had a mini photoshoot.
