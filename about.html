            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Senior Product Designer specializing in transforming complex technical constraints into intuitive, high-impact user experiences. With over a decade of experience at companies like Axon and Amazon, I focus on solving 'unsolvable' administrative bottlenecks—whether that's reducing deployment times by 50% through hardware-to-software service design or architecting automated discovery engines. I thrive at the intersection of physical and digital worlds, using deep research and systems thinking to create tools that empower users in high-pressure environments</p>

            <h3>I'm a user advocate</h3>
            <p>
                I have a passion for simplifying the complicated. I take ideas from concept to release. I'm great at establishing trust and building productive relationships with team members. I'm a flow diagraming, layout wire-framing, requirements redlining, CSS coding, JS hacking digital designer. Creating, intuitive user-centered products is what I do best.

                    <p>In 2016 I moved to Sketch as my primary UX design tool. It's still a bit buggy but the plugins are great and it was easy for me to learn the advanced features. Here is an example of the Castle UX kit I built using the Atomic Design methodology.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I try to use Axure as much as I can when it comes to prototyping. I don't get to use it as much as I like to but when I do I'm very comfortable with its advanced features thanks to their helpful tutorials!</p>

                    <p>I've been using Photoshop since the mid 90's and Illustrator since the early 2000's. They were my primary design tools for years, but now I mainly use them for print and illustration.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>I've been writhing HTML and CSS for years and enjoy doing it when I get the opportunity. I'm comfortable with common frameworks like bootstrap and material. I can hack JS to do what I want (most of the time) but that's pretty much where my coding skills end.</p>

                    <p>When it comes do making software look pretty I tend to take the minimalist route. But being that my career started when skeuomorphic design was all the rage, I also enjoy taking that direction if it makes sense for that particular product.</p>

                    I'm into retro gaming. If you ask me, 8 bit and 16 bit era games are still some of the best gaming experiences around. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently a couple of guys developed a tool called <a href="http://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/">NESmaker</a>. A WISYWIG tool to create NES games that you can play on real NES hardware without having to mess around with much code at all. Its been a dream of mine to create my own NES game since I was a kid so I spend most of my free time working on that.
