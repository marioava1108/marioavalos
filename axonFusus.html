            <h2>Optimizing Path to Value: Reducing Support Volume by 60%</h2>
            <h4>What is Fusus?</h4>
            <p>Think of Fusus as the "universal translator" for public safety data. It is a Real-Time Crime Center in the Cloud (RTC3) platform that aggregates disparate data sources—such as live video feeds, CAD alerts, and gunfire detection—into one unified, map-based interface for dispatchers and officers.</p>
            <h4>What is a Fusus Core?</h4>
            <p>The Fusus Core is the physical "bridge" that makes the magic happen. It is a small, plug-and-play hardware appliance installed at a specific site (like a school, a business, or a city park). It securely connects local security cameras to the Fusus network, allowing those feeds to be shared with first responders in real-time without requiring expensive IT upgrades to the existing camera system.</p>
            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>As a Senior Product Designer at Axon, I led the design strategy that drove a 60% reduction in support volume and empowered business owners to get online independently. Building on my initial work designing mission-critical workflows for patrol officers and dispatchers, I transformed a high-friction technical process into a scalable, user-friendly configuration experience for real-time crime centers. This focus on systems thinking and cross-functional collaboration resulted in a 60% reduction in support call volume and accelerated time-to-value for enterprise customers.</p>

            <h3>The Challenge: Bridging the Physical-Digital Gap</h3>
            <p>
                The FUSIS Core is a gateway device that connects private security cameras to first responders. Previously, 100% of installations required a manual call to customer support, creating a massive bottleneck. Our mission: cut deployment times by 50% and drive a 60% reduction in support volume over nine months.

            <h3>The Strategy: Becoming the User</h3>
            <p>
                To design the solution, I first had to experience the problem. I ordered a Core to my home and documented every friction point—from the lack of out-of-box documentation to the technical anxiety of "messing with the router."

            <h3>Identifying the Choke Points</h3>
            <p>
                By mapping the journey from purchase to "active," we found three critical failures:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Administrative Friction: Serial numbers weren't pre-assigned to organizations, requiring manual backend work before the box was even opened.</li>
                <li>Network Hurdles: Non-technical business owners struggled with firewalls and IP configurations.</li>
                <li>Camera Discovery: Users had to manually find and test complex RTSP URLs to connect their cameras.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Solution: A Device-Aware Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>
                We didn't just redesign the UI; we redesigned the service.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Troubleshooting Engine: We built a "device-aware" chatbot. By scanning a QR code, the system identified the specific hardware model and provided a tailored, interactive setup guide.</li>
                <li>Automated Discovery: We implemented MAC-address-based detection to automatically pull RTSP URLs, achieving a 95% automated camera detection rate.</li>
                <li>End-to-End Visibility: We designed a health dashboard for first responders so they could monitor camera status and storage levels, preventing support calls before they happened.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Results: A 60% Reduction in Support Volume</h3>
            <p>
                By launching the self-service wizard and chatbot, we moved from 0% to 60% customer-led installations. This significantly reduced operational costs and validated our "service-design" approach: focusing on the journey from the point of purchase, not just the pixels on the screen.

            <h3>Retrospective & Key Takeaways</h3>
            
            <p><b>Design Extends Beyond the Screen</b><br>The Lesson: In hardware-software ecosystems, the "User Experience" begins the moment the box is opened, not when the URL is typed.</p>
    
            <p><b>Identifying "Latent" Internal Talent</b><br>The Lesson: Speed doesn't always require more headcount; it requires better alignment.</p>
                
            <p><b>The Power of "Ground Truth" Feedback</b><br>The Lesson: Your internal Support teams are your best UX researchers in a high-velocity environment.</p>
